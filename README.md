# multi-cloud-app-deployment
This repository contains a comprehensive setup for deploying a Node.js application using a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. The project includes infrastructure as code using Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, monitoring and logging setup, security integration, and configuration management with Ansible. Additionally, an optional multi-cloud strategy is provided.


Prerequisites
Jenkins server with necessary plugins (Git, Docker, etc.)
Docker installed on Jenkins agents
AWS account with access to EC2, VPC, RDS, IAM, and S3
Kubernetes cluster (EKS or self-managed)
Prometheus and Grafana setup
Python installed for automation scripts
Ansible installed for configuration management

CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Pull Code: The Jenkins pipeline pulls the code from GitHub repository.

Unit Testing: Runs unit tests using npm test to ensure code quality.

Docker Build and Push: Builds the application into a Docker container using the provided Dockerfile and pushes it to a Docker registry.

Deployment: Deploys the Docker container to the specified cloud provider (AWS EC2 or Kubernetes).

How to Run:
Clone this repository
Set up Jenkins with the provided Jenkinsfile
Configure the required environment variables and credentials


Infrastructure Deployment


AWS Infrastructure

VPC: Terraform script to provision a VPC, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
EC2 Instance: Provision an EC2 instance to host the application.
RDS Database: Set up an RDS instance with the necessary configurations.
Security Groups and IAM Roles: Define and attach security groups and IAM roles for EC2 and RDS.

How to Run:
Navigate to the terraform/aws/ directory.
Run terraform init followed by terraform apply.

Kubernetes Deployment

Multi-Container Pod: Deploys the Node.js application in a multi-container pod.
Service: Exposes the application using a Kubernetes service.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: Automatically scales the application based on resource usage.
ConfigMap and Secret: Manages application configuration through ConfigMaps and Secrets.

How to Run:
Navigate to the kubernetes/ directory.
Run kubectl apply -f .

Monitoring and Logging Setup
Prometheus and Grafana: Set up using a docker-compose.yaml file.
ELK Stack: Configures Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for centralized logging.

How to Run:
Navigate to the monitoring/ directory.
Run docker-compose up -d

Security Integration
OWASP ZAP: Integrated into the Jenkins pipeline for security scanning.
Network Policies: Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are used to restrict pod-to-pod communication.

How to Run:
Ensure Jenkins is configured to run OWASP ZAP scans.
Apply the network policies using kubectl apply -f security/network-policies.yaml.

Automation Script
Health Check: A Python script that performs a health check on the deployed application.
Database Credential Rotation: Automates the rotation of database credentials.
Data Backup: Automates the backup process for the application data.

How to Run:
Run the script in the automation/ directory: python healthcheck.py

Configuration Management
Ansible Playbook: Installs and configures Nginx as a reverse proxy and sets up SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.

How to Run:
Navigate to the ansible/ directory.
Run ansible-playbook playbook.yaml

Multi-Cloud Strategy (Optional)
Azure Infrastructure: Terraform scripts for setting up a similar infrastructure in Azure.
Traffic Distribution: Implements DNS-based load balancing to distribute traffic between AWS and Azure.

How to Run:
Navigate to the terraform/azure/ directory.
Run terraform init followed by terraform apply.

Improvements and Scaling
High Availability: Implement load balancers and auto-scaling groups for high availability.
Security: Incorporate additional security measures such as WAF and enhanced IAM roles.
Monitoring: Expand monitoring capabilities by adding more metrics and dashboards.

Assumptions and Design Decisions
The Node.js application is containerized using Docker.
Jenkins is the CI/CD tool, and itâ€™s configured with Docker and AWS plugins.
Terraform is used for infrastructure as code across AWS and Azure.
Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, with a focus on AWS EKS.
Monitoring and logging are set up using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack.
Security is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes network policies.


How to Run and Test
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up Jenkins with the provided Jenkinsfile, and trigger the pipeline to build, test, and deploy the application.
Infrastructure: Use the Terraform scripts in the terraform/aws/ directory to provision the infrastructure on AWS.
Kubernetes: Apply the Kubernetes manifests in the kubernetes/ directory to deploy the application to your cluster.
Monitoring: Use Docker Compose to start Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for monitoring and logging.
Security: Run OWASP ZAP scans from the Jenkins pipeline and apply network policies using Kubernetes.
Automation: Run the Python scripts in the automation/ directory for health checks, credential rotation, and data backup.
Configuration Management: Use Ansible to set up and configure Nginx, SSL, and firewall rules.
